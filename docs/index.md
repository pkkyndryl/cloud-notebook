## Welcome to "Cloud Notebook"

_Continuously being updated._

The purpose of this github site is to provide a way to publish and share information I've gathered on how key aspects of Public Clouds work.  

In this site, you will find architectural walkthroughs that I've created to help me understand, (and explain to other!),  key aspects such as security, networking etc...  These walkthroughs follow an approach that I've found useful in understanding concepts over the years. I've typically create a picture that highlights the key elements and relationships of the domain in question, then walk the reader through it to explain the concepts. Some of you may recognize this as a `subject area view`.

Since, I work with a number of public, and private, cloud providers and architectures, I find that there are many things in common. Hence, I've started to organize this information here.

Now ... a key point: I'm not trying to replicate all the info that is out on the cloud providers, or the internet. My goal here is to hopefully net out the information in perhaps a different way.

I hope you find this approach as helpful as I have. From Index.md
