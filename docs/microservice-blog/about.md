# Microservices: Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow

This section of the Cloud Notebook contains a re-posting of blog content I wrote several years ago.

It's focus is on MicroServices. It has it's roots in work I did in the late 90's building distributed object solutions for Andersen Windows, Cargill, and Carlson WagonLit Travel.It goes on to reflect my time at IBM.

I originally published this via Wordpress.com, but I decided to move the content here to align with my other material, and to eliminate the ads that were showing up. 

I wrote this at the time to share my perspectives and lessons learned relative to distributed, microservice based applications.  You will notice references to a paper I wrote in 2001 while in IBM Global Business Services.  I have not posted that here yet, but I may.  

It also references many software tools and products that are no longer available or have morphed into something else.  I left these in the blog posts for historical purposes, though I probably will make a pass to change the technology names when I get a chance.

While these blog posts are "older", I believe that the content, approaches, and messages I try to get across still, for the most part apply to day to day needs of a Solution Architect.
