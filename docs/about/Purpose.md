# About

I’ve learned many things in my many years in IT, but some stand out:

1. we, as IT professionals are inundated with materials to market, sell, explain, IT architectures, software products/services, or hardware :  websites, youtube videos, documents, presentations, blah blah blah   .. RESULT:  a flood of information
    - remember.. whether it’s in the cloud or not.. it’s all still architecture, software, and hardware. This has been a constant over my career.

2.  IT professionals tend to like to give you Nth detail to explain all the features, bells/whistles, etc… that you may ever want to know… RESULT:   the message they are trying to get across often is lost

3. For some reason, many IT Professionals, that I’ve known anyway,  have a hard time explaining something visually. .. A Picture.   I don’t know why. The RESULT:  you are left to try to visualize something you can’t see anyway with pages of words OR at best a “marketecture” picture.    
    - This is fine when selling something.. but NOT to understand how the architecture works and interconnects.  Details matter.

4. The are more things in common than different between many vendors offerings. Having a solid foundation in the common denominators is key.  Too often, perhaps based on our role, employer, career history, we don’t recognize this. The RESULT:   we have a hard time pivoting to understand other options.

5. Sometime you need to “pick up a hammer” and just try things to understand them.   This is even more true today when the barriers to entry for learning something are so much lower than in the past.

Now I’ve been guilty of all of this myself.  But I’ve also seen the power of helping people grow in their knowledge by providing them with information in a way that visually explains something by walking them through a picture AND netting out the key points of an architectural concept, software tool, cloud provider, etc….

So…  My intent with this site is to try to help those of you reading learn more in less time.   Now, I’m not always going to be successful, but that is my intent.  I hope you find the information helpful.
